# Loops

1.Ð¡reate df_for_loop
```{r}
set.seed(42)
df_for_loop <- data.frame(
  id = 1:50,
  question_1 = sample(1:7, 50, replace = T),
  question_2 = sample(1:7, 50, replace = T)
)
```

2. Loop over each row of df_for_loop and compute mean of scores of question_1 and question_2 ((q1 + q2)/2). Hint: use nrow() to get number of rows. Save the resulting vector to *vector_mean*

# Choices

```{r}
vector_loop_if <- c(1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2)
```

3. Loop over each value of vector_loop_if. If the value of this vector is odd, then add to this value 1. Assign results to *vector_even*

# API

4. Go to [ProgrammableWeb](https://www.programmableweb.com/) and find at least three APIs with an access to a database. Write down your answer to *answer_4* as a vector with three values.
5. Create a query (with read_json) that returns JSON data WITHOUT API Key. Save resulting list to a *list_5* variable.
