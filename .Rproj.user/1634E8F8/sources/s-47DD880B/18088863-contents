This is an automatically graded assignment. That is why you need to follow instructions to the letter (especially on naming resulting variables).Name it using the following pattern: SURNAME_NAME-HW_1.R

## Creating basic objects 

1. Create a vector of three integers. Assign the results to *vector_1*;
2. Create a vector of two logical values. Assign the results to *vector_2*;
3. Create a matrix of two rows and three columns. Assign the results to *matrix_3*;
4. Create a factor of ten elements that contains education level (Bachelor, Master, PhD). Assign the results to *factor_4*;
5. Create a list that contains three vectors: character one, factor one, and logical one. Assign the results to *list_5*;
6. Create a data frame that contains five rows and three named columns (id, name, email). Assign the results to *df_6*;

## Understanding the functions and arguments of various functions

EXAMPLE:
Write down the function name that creates a data.frame?
```{r}
answer_example <- 'data.frame()'
```

7. Call help on a function **sort()**. What does it do? Write down value of an argument **na.last**, that will remove all NAs in a vector. Assign the answer to *answer_7*;
8. Write down the function name to generate random sequence of normal distribution values with specified mean and sd. Assign the answer to *answer_8*;
9. Write down the argument name to assign row names in data.frame(). Assign the results to *answer_9*;

## Simulating data

10. Create a data frame with several columns:

  - id - 10 integer values
  - gndr - 10 factor values
  - age - 10 integer values
  - salary - 10 double values
  - satisfaction_level - 10 factor values
  - comments - 10 character values
  
Assign the results to *df_10*;
